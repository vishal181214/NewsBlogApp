        "content": "According to a Ukrainian press release, the two parties discussed the current situation on the frontline, as well as Ukraine’s ten-point Peace Formula. Ukraine continues to fight on the battlefield, but at the same time has proposed a peace plan—a ten-point Peace Formula that provides comprehensive answers to the question of what needs to be done to end the war in a sustainable and just manner,” the press release said. The document is based on such fundamental principles as the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of states within internationally recognised borders, it added. Mr. Yermak told Mr. Doval that Ukraine is interested in the broadest possible support for the resolution, in particular from the countries of the Global South, adding that India’s cooperation is very important to Ukraine. We believe that you will support our resolution, as it contains very correct wording on the inviolability of borders and territorial integrity. Our goals are transparent and clear: we do not claim a single centimeter of Russian territory, we just want to get ours back,” he said. Mr. Yermak reiterated that the resolution is a fundamental one since it restores respect for international law and the U.N. Charter in the world. It is very important to protect the territorial integrity of any state in the world in order to prevent any attempts by one country to appropriate the territory of another one in the future. While Mr. Yermak said that Ukraine welcomes initiatives that will accelerate the chances to end the ongoing conflict and restore Ukraine’s territorial integrity, he emphasised that these should not be partial temporary solutions such as a ceasefire. He maintained for a complete withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukrainian territory. Otherwise, peace will be unstable, and this is unacceptable for Ukraine, the press release said. The parties agreed to maintain close contact on the eve of the U.N. General Assembly vote, it added.",
        "cont": "In October 2022, 143 UNGA members had voted to condemn Russia’s annexation of Ukrainian territories. Five countries, including Russia, voted against the resolution. India was among the 35 countries that abstained from the vote. Earlier this month Mr. Doval had attended the fifth meeting of NSAs on Afghanistan in Moscow, which was also addressed by Russian President Putin. In an expanding diplomatic initiative, Mr. Doval, alongside Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has maintained communication with both the Russian and the Ukrainian sides since the start of Russia’s special military operation” against Ukraine in February 2022. New Delhi has consistently maintained its stance for the Russia and Ukraine to resolve the crisis through dialogue and diplomacy, In his bilateral meeting with Russian President Putin in Uzbekistan on September 16 last year, Mr. Modi said today's era is not of war ‘War can and should be ended this year’ We are absolutely convinced that the war can and should be ended this year, so that the anniversary of the beginning of the full-scale invasion will be the first and last in our history,” Mr. Yermak told Mr. Doval over call."

We grab a small sandwich in the morning and sometimes are compelled to skip lunch, due to which we significantly bring down the overall calorie intake of the day. Doing this for a few days may not affect your body but not eating enough for weeks and months can have several consequences. A busy schedule isn't the only reason behind undereating but some people tend to deliberately eat less to lose weight and achieve a desired physique.",

The silence from the rover continues, so does from the Chinese state. Zhurong went in hibernation in May 2022 during winter in Mars' northern hemisphere. The available solar energy was less. The rover was expected to wake up in December 2022. However, there has hardly been any news on the rover from the Chinese authorities and the status of the rover remains unknown. No new images from the rover have been released. Unlike other Mars rovers, Zhurong does not have a heating unit. It has two windows to allow a chemical to store heat energy obtained on Mars. The chemical, by the name n-undecane, absorbs heat during the martian day and melts. It releases heat during the night and solidifies.",
        "cont": "Mars has atmosphere and dust storms are a normal occurrence on the Martian surface. Though these storms are of much lesser intensity than those on Earth, it is being reported that martian storms may have been the reason why the rover may not have been able to generate enough heat. However, there has been no official confirmation on this from China. You can now write for wionews.com and be a part of the community. Share your stories and opinions with us here."

Caste discrimination has no place in society anywhere in the world, including here in America. That is why some colleges and universities have banned it on campuses, and workers are fighting for their rights and their dignity in cases involving caste discrimination, she said. Equality Labs, the brain behind the anti-caste discrimination resolution in Seattle and which has been spearheading a nationwide campaign said: Love has won over hate as Seattle has become the first in the nation to ban caste discrimination. We have braved rape threats, death threats, disinformation, and bigotry. It has created a coalition of some 200 organisations in support of its efforts over the issue.",
        "cont": "Central to this coalition is a network of more than 30 anti-caste Ambedkarite organisations, Equality Labs said. Among them are the Ambedkar King Study Circle, Ambedkar International Center, Ambedkarite Buddhist Association of Texas and Boston Study Group. The Hindu American Foundation, which had campaigned against the resolution, said singling out South Asians and the addition of ‘caste' to the non-discrimination policy violates the very policies it now amends.The City of Seattle has voted to treat South Asians (and Southeast Asians and African) in a manner that no other ethnic or racial community is treated under the guise of non-discrimination. It has voted yes to discriminating against ethnic minorities, repeating the ugliness of nativists in the state nearly a century ago, Suhag Shukla, co-founder and executive director of the Hindu American Foundation said.In passing this resolution, Seattle is now in violation of the US Constitution's guarantees of equal protection and due process that prohibit the state from treating disparately people on account of their national origin, ethnicity, or religion, and implementing a vague, facially discriminatory and arbitrary category, Mr Shukla alleged.Seattle has taken a dangerous misstep here, institutionalising bias against all residents of Indian and South Asian origin, all in the name of preventing bias, said HAF managing director Samir Kalra."

However, we are still in early days of retail investors reaching maturity in market behaviour and most of them loose money due to over trading.
